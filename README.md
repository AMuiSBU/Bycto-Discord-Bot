# Bycto-Discord-Bot

Author: [Andrew Mui](https://github.com/AMuiSBU)

## About

A personal discord bot used to browse eBay items swiftly and conveniently

## Features

Bycto currently offers one command to search for items based on:
* Query: Keyword(s) 
* Limit: Number of items to display

## Installation Requirements

Bycto does not have a permanent online version at the moment as it is still W.I.P

However, you may host it locally if you want to, but it requires several steps

Heads-up: this will take 24 hours at the minimum if you are not a member of the eBay Developers Program.

### Discord

Follow a tutorial to create a discord bot [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

### Ebay Token

The bot requires an eBay OAuth Application Token. To obtain this, you must sign up for the eBay Developers program [here](https://developer.ebay.com/join)

### Running the Application

Run the following line in terminal to install the necessary packages:
   
> pip install -r requirements.txt

Input the appropriate tokens into the config.py file and run bot.py
